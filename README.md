# Science of Data Visualization
Welcome to the Science of Data Visualization repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring various aspects of data visualization using Python.

## About
In this repository, we delve into the science behind data visualization techniques, aiming to provide clear explanations and practical examples using Python code. Our goal is to help learners understand the principles of effective data visualization and how to apply them in real-world scenarios.
## Content
- Heatmaps: Explore the distribution of data using heatmaps in Python with Google Colab. Gain insights into your data and enhance your visualization skills.
- 3D Scatter Plot: Scatter plots are great for visualizing relationships between multiple data points, and adding a third dimension allows us to explore even more!
## How to Use
To get started, simply navigate to the respective directories for each topic of interest. Each directory contains Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or Google Colab notebooks with explanations and examples. You can run the code snippets provided to see the visualization in action and further customize them to suit your needs.
